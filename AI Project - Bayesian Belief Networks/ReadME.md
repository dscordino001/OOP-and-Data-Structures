Problem:

1. Mary has a Chihuahua puppy, Lupa, that stays at home while she goes to class, and Lupa likes to bark at noises she hears from outside. If Lupa barks loud enough, there is a chance her neighbor, Marco, will be perturbed and call the apartment super. A mail truck delivers mail daily. The mail truck, by itself has a 30% chance of causing Lupa to bark and has a 75% chance of being outside while Mary is at class. The lawn mower, since they seem to mow all the time, has a 25% chance by itself of causing Lupa to bark and has a 15% chance of being outside while Mary is in class. Marco will be perturbed 35% of the time if Lupa barks.
2. What is the chance of Marco being perturbed if the mail truck arrives while people are cutting grass? Use Bayesian Belief theory.
3. Must have these things to get full credit:
   a. Bayesian network drawing
   b. Equations used
   c. Probability tables
   d. List of all assumptions made.
