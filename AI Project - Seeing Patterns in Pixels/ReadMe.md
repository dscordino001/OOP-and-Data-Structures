a. You are developing software to find the Early Christian ‘fish’ shapes carved into the tufa
in a new set of tunnels you found under Rome. You have an infrared camera on a stand
that can reduce the image to black and white. Your prior work found that the shape of
the fish indicated a particular person (or couple) in the group.
b. You have hundreds of images, but a few samples (125x125 pixels) are like fish1 and fish3 .png files
c. Write the code to automatically reduce each image to the focused, aligned, oriented, sized, and clarified fish part so that the neural network classifier can determine the artist(s).
